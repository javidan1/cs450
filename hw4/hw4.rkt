;; Exercise 4 (Manually graded)
#|
位-Racket without environments is the better alternative when we have a small number of variables that do not change value during the course of the program.
位-Racket with environments is the better alternative when we have lexical scope.

;; Exercise 5 (Manually graded)
#|
The main advantages can be that a formal specification presents is an easy-to-understand version and makes it effortless to understand the behavior of the code.
Secondly, formal specfications can help us develop test cases. Developing test cases is important to ensure that our code satisfies the given requirements.
